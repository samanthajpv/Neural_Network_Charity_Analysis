# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
A neural network analysis on charity funding data

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier to predict the success of investing in charities funded by a certain organization. Using tensorflow, together with scikit-learn and pandas, a number of optimization modifications were made to see if the model can achieve an accuracy of 75%. The charity dataset contains the following information:
- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding 
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application 
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

## Results
 
### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
### Optimization
#### Trial 1: Add neurons
#### Trial 2: Add hidden layer
#### Trial 3: Change activation
#### Trial 4: Revisit Features
